"It was in a sequence way.and all topics are so much cleared and presentation was also so good.We are also be given teach back session by the trainer that is really good.Trainer make us feel free ,so we can ask our doubt whatever it is.It was a very good training."
As we are new partners it takes it time for us to understand how things work in backend . so I think little bit of explanation of backend work would help us draft the procedure and have more understanding on it - little more explanation and more example to be used
"There is no least valuable part of the whole training. However I just wanted to add that there can be more engagement activities with partners so we can build rapo with other partners as well.I do understand that there could time constrain, but we can try and do this."

"Revisions were the highlight of the course. It helped me to have a good grasp on the subject matter and allowed me to take notes of any small items if I had missed previously.Moreover, the trainers have put in a lot of effort; always ready to go the extra mile to clear our doubts and encouraged participation from all. Kahoot sessions were like knowledge served in small packets and helped us in pushing our brains in the nick of time."

"It was really a nice experience for me re-enter in an environment where I got opportunity to learn more and more and to get deep idea about basics of Asset Management, Wealth Management, Corp and institutional client services. Nice to get a glance over what all about the IOO is, what all are the key process and sub- process are inter-connected to each other. Trainers were enough confident, polite and off course highly expertise to guide and direct if case of any issue in any topics. Sessions were really interesting encouraged through various games and virtual team engagements. NT should really be appreciated to take us in journey of lessons before step in any working environment."
